🍽️ Food Handling Robotic Arm

An automated robotic system designed to handle packed food items safely and efficiently using a robotic arm, conveyor belt, and QR-code–based identification.

📌 Project Overview

The Food Handling Robotic Arm project aims to improve hygiene, accuracy, and speed in food handling by reducing human involvement. The system uses a robotic arm integrated with a conveyor belt and a camera-based QR scanning mechanism to automatically pick, sort, and place packed food items to their respective destinations.

This solution is suitable for small to medium-scale food industries and Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) where fast and reliable order handling is essential.

🧩 Autodesk Fusion 360 – Robotic Arm Design

File Name: Food_Handling_Roboticarm_Design

Software Used: Autodesk Fusion 360

The robotic arm used in this project was designed and modeled using Autodesk Fusion 360. The software was selected for its powerful parametric modeling tools, easy assembly management, and accurate visualization capabilities, which are well suited for robotic system design.

The complete robotic arm design includes:

Base structure

Shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints

End-effector (mechanical gripper)

Servo motor mounting brackets

Linkages and joint connections

Each component was modeled individually and then assembled to ensure proper alignment, range of motion, and mechanical stability. Joint constraints and motion limits were applied to simulate real-world arm movements and to verify reachability and workspace.

🌐 Roboslice – Food Ordering Web Application

Application Name: Roboslice

Live Link: https://roboslice.onrender.com/

Type: Web-based food ordering system

Roboslice is a web application developed to manage food orders digitally and integrate seamlessly with the automated food handling system. It allows customers to place orders easily and generates a unique QR code for each order, which is later used by the robotic arm system for identification and sorting.

📝 Order Creation Process

Using the Roboslice web application, the user can place an order by providing the following details:

Food item selection

Customer name

Quantity of items

Order type (Dine-in or Takeaway)

Payment confirmation

Once all required inputs are submitted, the system automatically generates a unique QR code for the order.

🔲 QR Code Generation

Each order is assigned a unique QR code

The QR code contains essential order and customer information

This QR code is printed or attached to the food package or bill

The generated QR code is later scanned by the webcam-based QR scanner

This QR code acts as a digital link between the web application and the robotic arm system, enabling automated decision-making.

🔗 Integration with Robotic Arm System

The webcam scanner reads the QR code generated by Roboslice

Order data is decoded and processed

The system identifies the correct customer or destination

The robotic arm performs accurate pick-and-place operations

This integration ensures faster order handling, reduced errors, and minimal human involvement.
